Carmichael College is one of the few educational institutions in undivided Bengal that has achieved great fame. Founded in 1916, the college has a rich and glorious history. Since its inception, the college has been making a significant contribution to the education and culture of the Rangpur region. This college has given birth to many knowledgeable people who have played brilliant roles in various fields. After graduating from this college, many students later made their debut as famous doctors, lawyers, administrators, scientists, engineers, politicians. The students of this college were Shaheed Janani Jahanara Imam, two former students Abu Sadat Md. Sayem, Hussain Md.

Carmichael&#8217;s fame spread beyond the borders of Bengal to Assam, Cooch Behar, Jalpaiguri, Malda. As there were many hostels in the college, many students from greater Dinajpur and greater Rangpur districts used to come to study in this college.[\/et_pb_text][et_pb_text content_tablet=&#8221;&#8221; content_phone=&#8221;<\/p>\n<p style=%22text-align: justify;%22><a href=%22https:\/\/ccr.gov.bd\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Thomas_Gibson_Carmichael-1.jpg%22><img src=%22https:\/\/ccr.gov.bd\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Thomas_Gibson_Carmichael-1.jpg%22 width=%22100%22 alt=%22Thomas Gibson Carmichael%22 class=%22wp-image-228712 alignleft size-full%22 \/><\/a><strong><span style=%22color: #800000; font-size:16px;%22>Brief History<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\nIn fact Carmichael College itself is a living history. So it is not possible to present Carmichael College in a short range. At the beginning of the last century, that is, until 1916, there were many schools in the Rangpur region but there was no college. In 18, another ancient educational institution of Rangpur was established in 1832. In Rangpur Zilla School, an initiative was taken to introduce a college i.e. higher secondary class. But as a student it stopped. At that time Presidency College and a few other colleges were established in undivided Bengal centered around Calcutta. Similarly, there were two colleges in East and West Bengal. But there was no college in Jalpaiguri, Dinajpur, Rangpur, Bogra, Pabna and Malda except the famous Cooch Behar College run by the king of Cooch Behar in the heart of the state capital of Cooch Behar in North Bengal. Later, Mrityunjay Roy Chowdhury, a well-known zamindar of Kunti in the Rangpur region, donated 125 bighas of land to establish a first-class college in Rangpur. But he could not implement it without government approval. However, he continued to try and inspire other zamindars, wealthy individuals and educationists.<\/p>\n<p style=%22text-align: justify;%22>When Lord Thomas David Baron Carmichael, the then Governor of undivided Bengal, came to Rangpur in 1913, he was given a civic reception. At the reception, the Governor was requested to co-operate with the need to establish a first class college in the area. He paid homage to the request of all at the Rangpur civic reception and informed that three lakh rupees would be required at the initial stage for the establishment of a first class college. According to him, in 1913-14, Rangpur District Collector JN Gupta became actively involved in the establishment of the college. He convened a meeting with the kings, zamindars, wealthy people and educationists of the Rangpur region to raise funds for the establishment of the college. The top zamindars responded to his initiative and paid.<\/p>\n<p><a href=%22https:\/\/ccr.gov.bd\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Main_01.jpg%22><img src=%22https:\/\/ccr.gov.bd\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/09\/Main_01.jpg%22 width=%22100%22 height=%22184%22 alt=%22%22 class=%22wp-image-8 alignright size-medium%22 \/><\/a>There was an interesting incident in the meeting called for raising money which if not mentioned, the history of this college will remain incomplete. In that meeting of that day, he promised to give the amount of money to the then generous zamindars and rich people and recorded it on paper. In this case, the Tepar zamindar, while writing the 10,000 rupees pronounced in his mouth, mistakenly put a zero plus on the right side instead of the amount of money. As a result, the amount of his money is one lakh rupees. At the end of the meeting, when the amount of money written by everyone was being read, Annada Mohan Roy Chowdhury (Tepar Zamindar) was disturbed to hear the amount of money pledged. According to some, he fainted. However, he donated the amount of money pledged for the establishment of the college. To commemorate his donation, the hall in the middle of the spectacular main building at Carmichael College is named after him. That means %22Annada Mohan Hall%22. The names of all those who donated money and land for the establishment of the college are engraved in stone. Annada Mohan Roy Chowdhury Bahadur is the first name among 26 donors.<\/p>\n<p>Others who generously donated for the establishment of this college are: Kundi, Kasimbazar, Radhaballav, Dharmapur, Manthana, Tusbhandar, Mahipur&#8217;s Panga, Kurigram, Kholahati, Rasulpur zamindars, jotdars and wealthy and knowledgeable people. Some donate cash. Someone donated or donated land to build infrastructure. Surendra Nath Roy Chowdhury, the famous zamindar of Kunti and the most educated man of Rangpur at that time, is in the forefront in donating land. They donated about four hundred and fifty bighas of free land on behalf of the two brothers.<\/p>\n<p>At a public reception in Rangpur in 1913, Governor Lord Carmichael promised to raise three lakh rupees.

Which will rock the hearts of tourists at the first sight. The main building of the college was inaugurated on 12 February 1918 by the then Governor of Bengal, Earl of Ronald. The main building of the college, which is 610 feet long and 60 feet wide, is a unique example of architectural architecture. The rich history of Bengal is reminiscent of Mughal construction techniques. The immaculate architecture of the main building is enough to amaze the tourists at the first sight. The widespread use of domes is indicative of Muslim architecture. It has also enhanced the beauty of the small dome buildings in the top country. Marlon decoration has been added to enhance the beauty of the cornice. All in all, the main building of Carmichael College is a historical architectural masterpiece, a unique example of Indochina architectural convenience. This building is one of the sights of Rangpur.
